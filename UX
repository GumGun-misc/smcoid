smcoid:



unstructured ideas:

non_interactive should be the default: 
interactive should be behind flag -I
global: show all smcoids should be default when outside of a view -g
ENV var when set should be the default but should be able to be overwrote. flag to ignore ENV -n 
when only one is available it should be saved automatically -N

when inside the rac -l should avoid the instances from sorting
